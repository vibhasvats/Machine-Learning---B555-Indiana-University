This folder contains the programming assignment 4 of the Machine Learning course taken by prof. Roni Khardon in Fall'19 session.  

## The folder is organized as:

- file name "pp4.pdf" contains the description of the question that was given for the assignment by the professor.  
- file name "Latent_Dirichlet_Alloation_pp4.py" contains the complete code for the same. 
- there is additional file named "LatenDirichletAllocation-PP4.ipynb", which also contains the complete code along with descriptive notes.
- A picture is also there which plots the learning curve for LDA vs Bag-of-word model for the logistic regression.
- A file, topicwords.csv, contains the top five most frequent topics that were found after LDA applicaiton through Gibb's sampling. 

this is my original work from scratch.
